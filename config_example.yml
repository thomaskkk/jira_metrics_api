# How to connect to JIRA.
# You can generate your apikey at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
Connection:
    Domain: http://your_jira_instance.atlassian.net/ # your JIRA instance
    Username: Your_jira_login # your jira login
    ApiKey: Secret_here # your api token/key

# Query - a JQL query to gather data, if you are smart you will remove Epics, Sub-tasks and other items like the example bellow.
# NOTE: if you add more than 1 issuetype on JQL all of them must share the same workflow statuses!
Query: project = AG AND issuetype not in (Epic, Sub-task, Bug-task) AND resolution in (Done)

# Right now you can't change the 3 types: Story, Bug, Task, but you can group other jira issuetypes in each of those 3 options
Issuetype:
    Story: Story
    Bug: Bug
    Task: 
        - Task
        - Technical Debt

# Cycletime - A list of which columns the script should consider to calculate the cycletime
# Percentiles - that the script should return
# NOTE: for now cycletime percentiles and montecarlo percentiles should match
Cycletime:
    Status:
        - In Progress
        - Review
        - Done
    Percentiles:
        - 50
        - 85
        - 95

# Simulations - how many simulations we should run 10k should give you a good result
# Source - Which Throughput/day we should use to run the simulation, must be Story, Bug, Task or Throughput (sum of all 3)
# Percentiles - that the script should return, the script will return the nearest neighbor result
# NOTE: for now cycletime percentiles and montecarlo percentiles should match
# Simulation Dates - The start and end date of the Montecarlo simulation
# NOTE: If you are using the Gslides feature the Simulation Dates will be ignored as the script will provide these for you 
Montecarlo:
    Simulations: 10000
    Source:
